How to build/run program:
	If you don't want to build you can download pre-built program from "Release".
	If you want to build: I preffer Eclipse for building.
	Since this is a java program you will need to have JRE installed in order to run it.

	In order to build it you will need Java SE (Be sure to install a JVM with the same bit level as your IDE):
	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
	Appart from that you will need to include "swing" library into your IDE.

Usage:

	Open the file by inputing whole path, example C:\file.cetrainer  then click "Hack".
	If the file is in the same folder as this executable then click "Get relative path" for easier input.
	If the process works you should have readable file in .xml format at the same folder as executable named "output.xml".
	
	All file extensions are supported and the only thing that matters is that the file is protected  with CheatEngine algorithm as follows:
	3 way pass XOR encryption and then Zlib compression with string "CHEAT" as file header.
	If the file is not protected in that way it means that it is either not a CheatEngine trainer or it is using old protection method(maybe even some newer method).
