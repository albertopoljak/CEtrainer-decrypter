Open the file by inputing whole path, example C:\file.cetrainer\  then click "Hack"
If the process works you should have readable file in .xml format at the same folder as executable.
All file extensions are supported, only thing that matters is that the file is protected  with CheatEngine algorithm as follows:
3 way pass XOR encryption and then Zlib decompression plus string "CHEAT" as file header.
If the file is not protected in that way it means that it is either not a CheatEngine trainer or it is using old protection method(maybe even some newer method).
